README.txt|
===========

-Please check the CMSC461-ProjectReport for detailed information on the purpose
of each of the data tables.

-Information about how and where to insert/drop queries should be included there.

-To open the notepad, launch Jupyter notebook and open Demo_Notebook.ipynb from there.

-My implementation of the project doesn't include queryAll.sql and transactionsAll.sql.
Command line arguments that work properly can be seen in both the notebook and in the
pictures provided in the CertRUs-DB-Quickstart-Guide.
	- I was following the project pdf requirements much more than the submission page
	requirements... do know that I was focused more on the Jupyter notebook than
	on further modifications to the MySQL database.
